title: "Upgrade Your Toolbox with IDE Extensions"
abstract: |
  Developers are like mechanics: we need a good set of tools to do our job. But reality is often dissapointing - cryptic CLI tools, confusing configuration files and dreadful docs are everywhere.

  What if we could do better? Using IDE extensions, you can greatly improve your tools’ developer experience - and it’s not as scary as it seems!

  Are you trying to optimize the DX of a framework used by millions? Are you just trying to make your team’s life a little bit easier? Either way, I will show you how you can rapidly go from idea to a working VSCode extension and solve real-world problems.
