Save the date: the [next meetup][next-meetup] is scheduled for `Thursday, 22. October` at `19.00`. We meet at the venue `Coworking Space NÃ¼rnberg`.

After founding the community, the first FrankenJS meetup took place at the 23. October 2014. We're looking back at a amazing year with great meetups, awesome speakers and hosts and so many great attendees. Therefore we want to celebrate our _first bithday_ __with you__ this month.

Stay tuned for all the upcoming stuff! ;)
